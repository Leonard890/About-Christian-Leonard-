## Summary
Hello Humans! I am Christian Leonard. I am a student who is in the 11th grade at Brockton High School. Throughout my courses, I'm taking high-level classes to get a better chance of going to an Ivy League University, Harvard University. Also, I'm currently taking a computer science class, Code Lab, taught by Mr. Clifford.  

Throughout my life, I study to one day become an Engineer. I want to expand my knowledge about designs and with Mr. Clifford's help, I believe I can do it! I am currently taking Web Design with Mr. Francois. Every day, I would try to exercise on the weeknights and the weekends, I would go to the gym. I workout because it is one of the healthiest things to do. I'm also eating fruits, protein, vegetables, grains, and dairy. My favorite sport is soccer and I would play the sport sometimes because I have limited time to practice in either the weekend or weeknight. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to karate to defend myself against people who physically hurt people. Also, I like to dance on curtain occasions because it makes me feel better. In school, I would work on Algebra 1 and 2 because I have a feeling it could be on my SAT's someday. Working with other people can help me study for upcoming exams which can be considered a skill. I love to watch movies, television shows, and anime. 

## Family
My family is very important to me. My parents both graduated in universities in Haiti, then went to college again, in the U.S.A. They both had great jobs in Haiti where my mother had an excellent time. My dad's job was as a physics teacher. They moved because they wanted to have children. Throughout my life, I had a wonderful time because my parents were there. In my family, I have a mother, father, brother, and grandmother. My brother and I lived in Brockton for most of our lives. 

My younger brother, age 14, is thinking of becoming a programmer himself. As of right now, my father works as a co-teacher in South Middle School and my mother works as a Respiratory Therapist. They both tried so hard to help us with our goals. Sometimes, my dad helps me with my homework in Physics.
